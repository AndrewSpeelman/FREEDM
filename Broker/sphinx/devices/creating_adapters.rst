Each adapter type has a different set of values it requires to initialize itself.  All of these values are contained inside of an `<info>` tag located under `<adapter>`.  The exact content of the `<info>` tag will depend on the adapter type.  Currently the only interesting adapter type is an "RTDS" adapter, which can send state data to both RSCAD (via an FPGA) and PSCAD (via the PSCAD interface distributed with the DGI).
