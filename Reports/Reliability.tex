\title{Reliability Analysis For Group Management Algorithm Under Lossy Network Conditions: A Novel}
\author{Stephen Jackson}
\maketitle
\section{Abstract}
Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) is a promising field of study used to impove the
reliability of critical infastructure resources. To accomplish this, we augment
a physical distribution system with cyber controllers which manipulate the 
characteristic invariants of the system. These components must be throughly
analyzed to ensure that their behaviors under duress do not agitate the system
state. This work examines the effects of lossy network conditions on one of
the modules of a cyber controller for the FREEDM Smart Grid project.
