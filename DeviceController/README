This is fake code for an ARM device controller. The controller is responsible
for managing one or multiple physical devices that are connected to it. The
primary purpose of the controller is to send device state information to DGI and
send DGI commands to physical devices. To accomplish this, the controller must
participate in the device session protocol with the DGI.

This fake code exists to trick DGI into thinking that's happening.

How to use:

1) Make copies of controller.cfg.sample and dsp-script.txt.sample, without the
   .sample extensions.

2) Modify them.

3) Turn on the DGI.

4) Run the controller.
