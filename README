Building This Project

1. Begin by installing Boost. You may be able to use your system's provided
Boost package, or you may need to begin by downloading Boost from 
http://www.boost.org/users/history/. The only supported version is Boost 1.46.1.

2. If you are using a Boost package, skip to step 4.

If you aren't using a package of boost, build it by extracting the source
tarball you downloaded to your home directory, navigating to it, and
invoking `sh bootstrap.sh` and then `bjam`. This will build Boost.

3. Next, define the BOOST_ROOT environment variable in your `.bashrc` by setting
it to the directory you built Boost in. 

For example: `export BOOST_ROOT='~/boost/'`

4. Navigate to the `Broker` directory within the source you cloned from GitHub
and invoke `cmake .` This will prepare all the makefiles.

5. Lastly, call `make` and wait for the FREEDM project to build.

6. Refer to the FREEDM Wiki at https://github.com/scj7t4/FREEDM/wiki for
information on configuration.
